DATABASE INTEGRATION:
User Data Storage: Store user credentials (hashed passwords) and other relevant data securely in a database.
Session Management: Track user sessions to manage login states.

 Security Measures

    Input Validation: Sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent SQL injection and other 
    attacks.
    Password Hashing: Use a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt to store passwords.
    Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Add an additional layer of security with 2FA.
    SSL/TLS: Ensure data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS.


    Backend Logic

    Server-Side Authentication: Ensure the logic to verify user credentials is secure and efficient.
    Session Timeout: Implement session timeout to automatically log out users after a period of inactivity.
    Captcha: Implement a CAPTCHA system to prevent automated bots from logging in.
