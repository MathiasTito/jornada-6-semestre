UI/UX Considerations

    Responsive Design: Make sure the login page works well on all devices (mobile, tablet,
    desktop).
    Error Handling: Provide clear error messages for incorrect login attempts or other 
    issues.
    Accessibility: Ensure the login page is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., 
    screen reader compatibility).
